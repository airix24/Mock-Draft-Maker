TODO:

NEXT STEPS:
- Put back all the save features and whatnot, but lock 2023 NFL mocks (at least the contest entries)
    - Make it so all mocks are locked after contest time is up?

- Make contest page look much better and more professional
    - Make it so multiple contests can be shown at once
- Make home page look much better/cooler
- Incorportate NBA (and make it really easy to add any league's draft, NHL on May 27?)
    - When you click mock builder, you decide which draft to do
    - In saved drafts, you can choose which drafts you want to view (NFL or NBA and what year?)
- Make it look nicer in general. Different colors etc.
    - Copy UI elements from other places, no need to reinvent the wheel
- Set up analytics and events or whatever
- Get players from API (might need to web scrape)
- Better social buttons
- Set up Discord?

IF YOU'RE DONE WITH THE NEEDS:
- Split up the one's and two's when looking at scores

- Expand thing?
- Make it so you can click drafted player and see their info?
- Update RAS
- Change star color
- Ads?
- Get rid of stuff to make it more professional?
- Add something to explain the points? Like a tooltip or something idk?
- Have draft saved in local storage if you go off of it

GET RID OF TO MAKE MORE PROFESSIONAL?:
- archetypes?
- strengths/weaknesses?

- hover over to see player?

RANDO:
- Make discord quick if it somehow gets popular (have link to it in the header probably)

- Click on team to get summary? (team needs, team tendencies, roster, cap space, etc.)
- Choose different years?
- Add expand all button?
- Make it so team needs that show up when you hover and what positions the team actually target are different? (eg. Philly has bigger needs than DL and OL but they still always target those positions no matter what)

GAMIFY IT:
