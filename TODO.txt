GAMIFY IT:

- Other social features?
- Put in money and compete in gpp?

"BACKEND":
- Add all picks

- update team needs for more realistic draft experience

BUGS:
- When you expand bottom player, have it so that player's card is completely visible
- Make it so pop up player card is always visible on the screen

- Make it so player pool container doesn't shrink when you toggle watchlist on

MISCELLANEOUS:

    - Get a message from the owner telling you not to screw it up at the beginning (this doesn't have to be AI I guess but could make it more personalized and random if it was)

    - AI assistant?
    - AI generated scouting reports?
    - Talk with AI to figure out who the best pick is? (kind wack)
